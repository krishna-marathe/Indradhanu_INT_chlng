Climate Change Research in India

This research paper examines the impact of climate change on agriculture in Maharashtra, India from 2010 to 2023. 

Our study found that temperatures increased by 1.5°C over the study period. Rainfall decreased by 20% in most regions including Pune, Mumbai, and Nashik. 

We used statistical analysis and machine learning to analyze the data. The research shows significant impacts on crop yields, with cotton production declining by 25%.

Key findings include:
- Temperature rise of 1.5°C
- 20% reduction in rainfall
- 25% decline in cotton yields
- Increased drought frequency

This study demonstrates the urgent need for climate adaptation strategies in Indian agriculture.
